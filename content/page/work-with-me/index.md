Real-world projects are great opportunities to apply one's skills and learn something valuable along the way. For this reason, I like to collaborate with external partners whenever possible. These collaborations can take two forms.

## Academic partnerships

Academic partnerships will involve one or more of my students. They can either be **internships** (from one to six months) or **group projects** (from a few weeks to a whole year!). In these partnerships, I usually play the role of a supervisor.

I teach at [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr), a graduate school that trains generalist engineers who are able to work on the various aspects of Human-Autonomy teaming. In three years, our students acquire a wide variety of skills in applied cognitive sciences and cognitive technology, including Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Industry, defense, transports, healthcare, human enhancement are some of the numerous possible application fields.

## Freelance consulting

If your project doesn't fit into the academic scope, I also do **consulting** as freelance. My areas of expertise include:

- Software engineering.
- Modern web development.
- Cross-platform mobile dev.
- Machine/deep learning: data analysis, model selection and training, deployment to production.
- AI history, perspectives and current issues.

My consulting services can involve **teaching**:

- Creation of custom training material: courses, textbooks, assessments...
- Animation of corporate worshops.
- Conference talks.
